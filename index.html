      <h2>1.Who we are?</h2>
      <p>
        We are are a non-profit company that recycles plastic and cleans plastic
        from water and land.

      <h2>Interesting things about plastic</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the last 15
          years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Production increased exponentially, from 2.3 million tons in 1950 to
          448 million tons by 2015. Production is expected to double by 2050.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes into the
          oceans from coastal nations. That’s the equivalent of setting five
          garbage bags full of trash on every foot of coastline around the
          world.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plastics often contain additives making them stronger, more flexible,
          and durable. But many of these additives can extend the life of
          products if they become litter, with some estimates ranging to at
          least 400 years to break down.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>2.What is our mission?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>prevent plastic from ending up in the environment</li>
        <li>
          share knowledge about the health risks related to plastics and plastic
          additives
        </li>
        <li>achieve absolute reduction in the production and use of plastic</li>

          <h2>Water pollution</h2>
          <p>
            These plastics come in many different forms. Just think about all
            the plastic items you use daily: the toothbrush you grab first thing
            in the morning, the container your lunch comes in, or the bottle you
            drink water from after your workout. All these things get used and,
            eventually, thrown out. Many plastic products are single-use items
            that are designed to be thrown out, like water bottles or take out
            containers. These are used and discarded quickly. If this waste
            isn’t properly disposed of or managed, it can end up in the ocean.
            Unlike some other kinds of waste, plastic doesn’t decompose. That
            means plastic can stick around indefinitely, wreaking havoc on
            marine ecosystems. Some plastics float once they enter the ocean,
            though not all do. As the plastic is tossed around, much of it
            breaks into tiny pieces, called microplastics.

          <h2>Land pollution</h2>
          <p>
            Researchers in Germany are warning that the impact of microplastics
            in soils, sediments and freshwater could have a long-term negative
            effect on such ecosystems. They say terrestrial microplastic
            pollution is much higher than marine microplastic pollution –
            estimated at four to 23 times higher, depending on the
            environment.The study estimates that one third of all plastic waste
            ends up in soils or freshwater. Most of this plastic disintegrates
            into particles smaller than five millimetres, known as
            microplastics, and these break down further into nanoparticles (less
            than 0.1 micrometre in size). The problem is that these particles
            are entering the food chain.
