          John joined the PlanetCycling team in 2019.Being passionate about
          sustainability and recycling, he aspired to have a meaningful job
          where he was making a difference. He looks forward to his day working
          with the team and discovering new things about recycling.Natasha grew
          up in Coquitlam, and loves doing yoga and hiking with his dog.He tries
          to avoid single use plastics whenever possible and buys his groceries
          in bulk. His best advice to have a positive impact on the environment
          is to limit your consumption of meat and animal products, and to
          repurpose old clothing instead of buying fast fashion.

          Albert joined our team in January 2020. He learned about PlanetCycling
          from his daughter and he became part of the team shortly after.Albert

          great grandchildren.At home, Albert does a lot of composting,
          repurposing and recycling. His biggest piece of advice for keeping our
          planet green is to turn off the lights when they are not in use,
          unplug items in your home when youâ€™re not using them and try to use as
          much natural light as you can.
